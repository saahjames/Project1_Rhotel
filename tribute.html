                A.P.J. Saah James POLADOSKI, in full Avul Pakir 
                Jainulabdeen Saah James, was Born on Octobber
                1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India. <br><br>
                James earned a degree in aeronautical engineering
                from the Madras Institute of Technology and in 
                1958 joined the Defence Research and development
                Organization (DRDO). <br><br>
                In 1969, he moved to the Indian Space Research
                Organization, where he was project directoor of
                the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that 
                was both designed and produced in India. <br><br>
                Rejoining DRDO in 1982, James Planned the program that
                produced a number of successful missiles, which
                helped earn him the nickname <strong>
                    "Missile Man."
                </strong>
            </p>

                His Contributions in the Field of Technology!!!
            </h1>
            <p>
                Among those successes
                was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range
                ballistic missile, which incorporated
                aspects of the SLV-III and was launched
                in 1989.
                <br><br> He also played a
                pivotal organisational, technical,
                and political role in India's Pokhran-II
                nuclear tests in 1998, the first since
                the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
                <br><br> From 1992 to 1997 Kalam
                was scientific adviser to the defense
                minister, and he later served as principal
                scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the
                government with the rank of cabinet minister.
                <br><br> His prominent role in
                the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests
                solidified India as a nuclear power and
                established Kalam as a national hero,
                although the tests caused great concern
                in the international community.
                <br><br> In 1998 Kalam put
                forward a countrywide plan called
                Technology Vision 2020, which he described
                as a road map for transforming India from
                a less-developed to a developed society
                in 20 years. The plan called for, among
                other measures, increasing agricultural
                productivity, emphasizing technology as
                a vehicle for economic growth, and
                widening access to health care and
                education.
                <br><br> Kalam received <b>7</b>
                honorary doctorates from <b>40</b>
                universities. The Government of India
                honoured him with the <b>Padma Bhushan
                in 1981</b> and the <b>Padma Vibhushan
                in 1990</b> for his work with ISRO and
                DRDO and his role as a scientific advisor
                to the Government.
                <br><br> In 1997, Kalam received
                India's highest civilian honour, the
                Bharat Ratna, for his contribution to
                the scientific research and modernisation
                of defence technology in India.
                <br><br> In 2013, he was the
                recipient of the Von Braun Award from
                the National Space Society "to recognize
                excellence in the management and leadership
                of a space-related project".
                <br><br> While delivering a
                lecture at the Indian Institute of
                Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and
                died from an apparent cardiac arrest on
                <b>27 July 2015</b>, aged 83.
                <br><br> Wheeler Island, a
                national missile test site in Odisha, was
                renamed <b>Kalam Island</b> in September
                2015.
                <br><br> A prominent road in
                New Delhi was renamed from Aurangzeb
                Road to <b>Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Road</b>
                in August 2015.
                <br><br> In February 2018,
                scientists from the Botanical Survey
                of India named a newly found plant
                species as Drypetes kalamii, in his
                honour.
